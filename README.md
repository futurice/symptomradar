# Symptomradar (Oiretutka) crowdsources coronavirus symptoms from news media audience

Symptomradar (Oiretutka in Finnish) is a service by software company Futurice and newspaper Helsingin Sanomat to crowdsource coronavirus symptoms from general public.

Crowdsourcing happens by asking questions in an embed that is placed on news media pages. The responses are stored without personally identifiable information. Results are shown in embeds and separate Oiretutka.fi or Symptomradar.com page.

The project is open source with MIT license. We encourage media outlets to collaborate within countries to create a service to map the spread of the virus. We welcome all contributors to the project.

# How to contribute

This project was developed in a hurry after the coronavirus really started spreading. So we don't have much documentation yet.

If you find any problems, please open an issue or submit a fix as a pull request.

We welcome new features, but for large changes let's discuss first to make sure the changes can be accepted and integrated smoothly. Discussion should take place in issue dedicated to the new feature.

Feel free to pick an issue and start contributing.

For good first issues regarding contributing, see issues labeled with [open sourcing improvements](https://github.com/futurice/symptomradar/labels/open%20sourcing%20improvements).
